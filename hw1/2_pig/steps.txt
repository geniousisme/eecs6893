These were some helpful commands as I was working

Pig commands
hdfs namenode -format
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /home/vagrant/hadoop
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal 2000.csv /home/vagrant/hadoop/
pig -x local totalmiles.pig




sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -copyFromLocal 2000.csv /home/hive/



I was also able to run this script using oozie and the following command
oozie pig -oozie http://vagrant-ubuntu-precise-64:11000/oozie -config job.properties -file totalmiles.pig 

the output was the same
