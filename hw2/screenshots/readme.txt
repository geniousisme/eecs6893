Unfortunately not all steps were screenshot since courseworks has an upload limit, so I screenshot the primary stuff.

First screenshot shows the generic template I used to compare the different functions. I swapped in different values for the Recommender type, the similarity, the neighborhood, etc.

Second screenshot shows another example.

Third screenshot shows some of the mapreduce clustering jobs running for K-means.

Next few screenshots show different steps along the way.

There are example outputs from the recommendations section.
